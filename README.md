## Automated Puzzle Solving

In this project I have implemented breadth-first search and depth-first search algorithms to solve logic puzzles. The algorithms were able to solve sodkus, word ladders, and expression tree puzzles. Some highlights of the steps taken are:
* Implement clases for the bfs and dfs solver
* Implement classes for each puzzles which specifies conditions on how to be solved
